# London Bike Rides Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is an exploration of London's bike ride data through web scraping, data cleaning, and visualization. The goal is to gain insights into the cycling patterns in London and present the findings in a user-friendly manner using Tableau.

## Repository Contents
- `data_collection/`: Directory containing scripts for web scraping bike ride data.
- `data_cleaning/`: Jupyter notebooks where the data is cleaned, processed, and prepared for analysis.
- `visualization/`: Tableau dashboard files providing a visual representation of the analysis.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Web Scraping**: Python with libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Python with pandas in Jupyter Notebook.
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau for creating an interactive dashboard.

## Installation
To set up the project environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jyeshtha1799/London_Bike_Rides_Data_Analysis.git
cd London_Bike_Rides_Data_Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
- Execute the scripts in the `data_collection/` directory to scrape the data.
- Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `data_cleaning/` directory for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Load the Tableau dashboard from the `visualization/` directory to analyze the visualized data.

## Data
Data for this project was obtained through web scraping techniques, with scripts available in the repository. The collected data underwent a thorough cleaning and preprocessing routine to prepare it for analysis.

## Visualizations
An interactive Tableau dashboard (`Dashboard.twbx`) visualizes the bike rides data. It includes various filters and selectors, allowing for a dynamic data exploration experience.

## Conclusions
The analysis of the data revealed key patterns and trends related to bike rides in London, highlighting aspects such as peak usage times, favored routes, and rider demographics.
