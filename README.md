# London Bike Rides Data Analysis

## Project Description
This repository is dedicated to an in-depth analysis of bike rides in London. The project encompasses the data science workflow from initial data acquisition to final visualization. It aims to extract meaningful insights from cycling patterns and present the findings via an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Technical Overview
- **Data Acquisition**: Automated Python scripts leverage libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for robust web scraping.
- **Data Wrangling**: Python's `pandas` library is employed for data transformation and preparation, ensuring a clean and analyzable dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilized `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for preliminary visual exploration to identify trends and outliers.
- **Data Visualization**: An interactive Tableau dashboard is created to facilitate the interpretation of the dataset through visual storytelling.

## Usage
- **Data Collection**: Navigate to the `data_collection/` directory and execute Python scripts to collect bike ride data from public sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: In the `data_cleaning/` directory, Jupyter notebooks are used for data cleaning, featuring techniques like null value imputation, outlier treatment, and categorical data encoding.
- **Visualization and Analysis**: The `visualization/` directory contains the Tableau workbook with advanced dashboard elements, providing an in-depth analysis of the dataset.

## Data
- **Structure**: The collected data is structured in CSV format post-cleanup, with attributes detailing ride durations, start and end locations, and timestamps among others.
- **Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing includes normalization, handling of missing values, and data type conversion for seamless integration with Tableau.
- **Security**: Data is anonymized to protect user privacy, with no personal identifiers included in the dataset.

## Visualizations
- **Dashboard.twbx**: This Tableau workbook is engineered to maximize user engagement, featuring interactive elements such as sliders, maps, and time series graphs.
- **Customization**: The dashboard allows users to filter data based on various parameters like time, date, and geographic location to drill down into specific areas of interest.

## Conclusions
In-depth analysis provided insights into usage patterns, peak times, and preferred routes, offering valuable data for urban planning and public transportation optimization.
