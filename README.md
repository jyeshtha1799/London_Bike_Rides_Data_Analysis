# London Bike Rides Data Analysis

## Project Description
This repository contains an analysis of bike ride patterns in London. The project encompasses the entire data science workflow: from data collection and cleaning to analysis and visualization. The aim is to discover insights into how bikes are used across London and to present these findings through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Usage
- **Data Collection**: Run the Python scripts located in the `data_collection/` directory to scrape bike ride data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Open and execute the Jupyter notebooks within the `data_cleaning/` directory to clean and preprocess the data.
- **Visualization**: Access the Tableau dashboard file in the `visualization/` directory to explore the data visualization.

## Data
The dataset was collected through a web scraping process, using custom Python scripts which can be found in this repository. The raw data was then cleaned and transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis.

## Visualizations
The `Dashboard.twbx` file is a Tableau workbook that contains interactive visualizations of the bike rides data. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, allowing for the exploration of data through various filters and control elements.

## Conclusions
Analysis of the data has uncovered interesting trends such as the most popular times for bike rides, common routes taken by riders, and demographic insights into the cyclists.
